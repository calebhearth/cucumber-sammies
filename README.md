Simple & tasty Cucumber step definitions for your Rails application. Many of these steps were originally created by [Spreewald](https://github.com/makandra/spreewald).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cucumber-sammies'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cucumber-sammies

## Usage

To use `cucumber-sammies` in your cucumber tests, add a line like this to your `features/support/env.rb` file.

```ruby
require 'cucumber/sammies/step_definitions/form_steps'
```

All the steps can be found in the [step_definitions directory](https://github.com/starfighterheavy/cucumber-sammies/tree/master/lib/cucumber/sammies/step_definitions)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
